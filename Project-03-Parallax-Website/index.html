        <h2>Meghalaya</h2>
        <p>Meghalaya meaning "abode of clouds"; from Sanskrit megha, Meghalaya is a state in northeast India. Meghalaya
            was formed on 21 January 1972 by carving out two
            districts from the state of Assam: the United Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills and the Garo Hills.
            The population of Meghalaya as of 2014 is estimated to be 3,211,474.Meghalaya covers an area of
            approximately 22,429 square kilometres, with a length-to-breadth ratio of about 3:1.

            The state is bound to the south by the Bangladeshi divisions of Mymensingh and Sylhet, to the west by the
            Bangladeshi division of Rangpur, and to the north and east by India's State of Assam. The capital of
            Meghalaya is Shillong. During the British rule of India, the British imperial authorities nicknamed it the
            "Scotland of the East".English is the official language of Meghalaya. Unlike many Indian states,
            Meghalaya has historically followed a matrilineal system where the lineage and inheritance are traced
            through women; the youngest daughter inherits all wealth and she also takes care of her parents.</p>

        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>With the average annual rainfall as high as 12,000 mm (470 in) in some areas, Meghalaya is the wettest place
            on Earth.[32] The western part of the plateau, comprising the Garo Hills region with lower elevations,
            experiences high temperatures for most of the year. The Shillong area, with the highest elevations,
            experiences generally low temperatures. The maximum temperature in this region rarely goes beyond 28 °C (82
            °F),[33] whereas sub-zero winter temperatures are common

            The town of Sohra (Cherrapunji) in the Khasi Hills south of capital Shillong holds the world record for most
            rain in a calendar month, while the village of Mawsynram, near Sohra (Cherrapunji), holds the record for the
            most rain in a year</p>
